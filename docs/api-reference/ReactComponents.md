# API Reference for ReactComponents

We are forking the [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) library for React components compatible with Bootstrap 4. For now, the canonical documentation for our fork is reactstrap's own documentation, but this will evolve as we continue making progress to make our users' workflows easier.

The key difference between our fork and the original library is that ours is focused on helping only our users be productive, while the original library aims to be broadly applicable to a wide audience with different use cases. The APIs and documentation will probably diverge to reflect our different goals.

## Import components

```javascript
import { Button, Popover } from 'lambdagrid/reactcomponents';
```
