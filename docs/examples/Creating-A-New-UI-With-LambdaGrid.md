# Creating a new UI with LambdaGrid

Let's create a new UI together using LambdaGrid!

## Hello World

We'll begin by creating an end-to-end Hello World app to demonstrate the skeleton of LambdaGrid.

First, create a new repository for your LambdaGrid UI, and create a `src/index.js` file. All of your configurations go into this file.

> *What about directory structure?*
>
> You can organize your files however you want, as long as they're inside the `src` folder and the `src/index.js` file will import it. We'll give you some good directory structure guidelines in this tutorial so you don't have to worry about accidentally mis-organizing your files.

Inside `src/index.js`, copy and paste the following code:

```javascript
import { ping, finish } from 'lambdagrid-mfi';
import React from 'react';

ping('ReactViews', 'create views', {
  HelloWorld: () => <div>hello world</div>,
});

ping('UrlRouting', 'create routes', {
  '^/$': ping('ReactViews', 'get view', 'HelloWorld'),
});

finish();
```

Almost done with our Hello World app. Finally, create a `src/index.html` file and paste the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" >
    <title>explore demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Check your browser, and you should now see "hello world" rendering inside of your new LambdaGrid application!

### Tinkering with Hello World

Before moving on to the next level of complexity, we encourage you tinker with your existing app. Try some of these different options:

1. Change the React code inside the `HelloWorld` React component. You can add links, change the text, etc.
2. Change the UrlRouting URL path. We set it to be the homepage with a regular expression. Try changing it to `^/new-route$` instead, and then you can see your React view is now rendering on the `/new-route` instead.
3. Try removing the `finish()` invocation at the end of `src/index.js`. Your UI should now not be running at all!
4. Try to misspell the first or second arguments in the `ping` invocations. You should be getting some console errors to warn  you of the typos.
