# Creating a new UI with LambdaGrid

Let's create a new UI together using LambdaGrid!

## Hello World

We'll begin by creating an end-to-end Hello World app to demonstrate the skeleton of LambdaGrid.

First, create a new repository for your LambdaGrid UI, and create a `src/index.js` file. All of your configurations go into this file.

> *What about directory structure?*
>
> You can organize your files however you want, as long as they're inside the `src` folder and the `src/index.js` file will import it. We'll give you some good directory structure guidelines in this tutorial so you don't have to worry about accidentally mis-organizing your files.
