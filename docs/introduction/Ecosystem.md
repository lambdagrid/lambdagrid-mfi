# Ecosystem

LambdaGrid's value to developers depends directly upon the breadth and depth of its ecosystem of packages.

## Packages for initial launch

The following are the packages that will be launched alongside LambdaGrid's base UI infrastructure technology, MFI.

* **AppState**, to handle CRUD operations to application state, like the "M" in "MVC"
* **ReactViews**, to create markup and styles in React, like the "V" in "MVC"
* **Pagelets**, to conjoin business data and presentation components with application logic, like the "C" in "MVC"
* **ReactComponents**, a comprehensive suite of React components that are compatible with Bootstrap 4
* **API**, for dispatching HTTP requests to API servers
* **UrlRouting**, to handle URL routing and serve the correct views to the user
* **TextManager**, a headless CMS to allow product managers to update copywriting without going through an engineer
* **Pages**, a composer for different Pagelets and the glue between URL routing and React views
* **DesignSystem**, a custom Bootstrap theme uploader and updater

## Roadmap

The roadmap is subject to change, but below is our roadmap of future packages, bucketed by priority.

Higher priority:
* **Flash Notifications**, to display asynchronous messages to users
* **Workers**, to create background processes
* **Monitoring, Alerting & Logging**, to create visibility into your UI's infrastructure and enable debugging

Lower priority:
* End-to-end testing
* Alternatives to React and Bootstrap
* Analytics
* Feature flagging
* Split testing
* Message inbox service
