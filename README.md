# About LambdaGrid

LambdaGrid is a UI builder for 1- or 2-person engineering teams. Configure a polished UI with LambdaGrid with small amounts of JavaScript, and ship your UI in a week instead of in months building it from scratch.

## Rationale

Small engineering teams have too much to build, but not enough engineers to build it. If you're limited on engineering help, then you need to prioritize how you spend your engineering time. The UI is typically expensive to build, which can frustrate small engineering teams when they want to focus on more important things.

LambdaGrid allows small engineering teams to express just the business logic configurations of their UI with simple JavaScript. The engineers can customize the UI to create the exact user experience they want, while delegating the UI's infrastructure and maintenance to LambdaGrid.
